# Build Engine Images Design

> **Repository:** `mincemeat-id/build-engine-images`
> **Status:** Design and decision documentation.
> **Audience:** Platform maintainers, build-engine maintainers, security
> reviewers.

The build-engine-images repository owns curated Docker images used by the
standalone build engine. Images are public GHCR artifacts with pinned digests,
SBOMs, provenance, vulnerability gates, and a versioned manifest consumed by
the engine.

## Goals

- Provide auditable, reproducible builder images for the supported frameworks.
- Keep image lifecycle independent from the engine binary.
- Pin image digests in a versioned manifest.
- Publish public GHCR images with SBOM and provenance.
- Block publication when the vulnerability budget is exceeded.
- Keep images free of secrets and platform credentials.

## Non-Goals

- User-supplied builder images.
- Dynamic runtime images for SSR applications.
- Private registry dependency.
- Multi-architecture images.
- Frameworks without fixture coverage.

## Image Matrix

| Logical Image | GHCR Tag Pattern                                              | Purpose                                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `node:20`     | `ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/node:20-X.Y.Z`      | Node LTS fallback and Node 20-only projects. |
| `node:22`     | `ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/node:22-X.Y.Z`      | Default Node image.                        |
| `bun:1`       | `ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/bun:1-X.Y.Z`        | Bun package manager / runtime.             |
| `hugo:latest` | `ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/hugo:X.Y.Z`         | Hugo static builds.                        |
| `zola:latest` | `ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/zola:X.Y.Z`         | Zola static builds.                        |

The default is image reuse where practical. Framework-specific images are only
added when a framework needs extra native dependencies or the generic Node
image would become too large.

## Base Image Policy

- Use Debian/Ubuntu-based official runtime images when possible for glibc and
  native dependency compatibility.
- Pin base image by digest in Dockerfiles or lock metadata.
- Install only required build tools:
  - `ca-certificates`
  - `curl`
  - `git`
  - `tar`
  - `xz-utils`
  - `python3`, `make`, `g++` only where needed for native npm modules
- Enable Corepack in Node images.
- Include no secrets, tokens, SSH keys, npmrc credentials, or platform config.

## Entrypoint Contract

Each image uses `/build-entrypoint.sh`.

Inputs:

| Path / Env             | Purpose                                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/build/manifest.json` | Build command, package manager, output dir, framework, root, env metadata. |
| `/workspace/src`       | Source root mount.                                                         |
| `/workspace/out`       | Normalized output mount.                                                   |
| `/cache`               | Package-manager cache mount.                                               |

Entrypoint responsibilities:

1. Read manifest.
2. Configure package-manager cache paths.
3. Run install command exactly as requested.
4. Run build command exactly as requested.
5. Copy or move the configured output directory into `/workspace/out`.
6. Preserve stdout/stderr for engine log streaming.
7. Exit non-zero on install/build/output copy failure.

The engine performs final output validation and artifact packaging; images
should not duplicate those checks beyond useful early errors.

## Manifest Contract

`manifest.json` in the images repo:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-19T00:00:00Z",
  "images": {
    "node:20": {
      "tag": "ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/node:20-1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "frameworks": ["astro", "vite", "eleventy", "docusaurus", "vitepress", "vuepress", "gatsby", "nextjs-export", "nuxt-generate", "sveltekit-static", "generic"]
    },
    "node:22": {
      "tag": "ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/node:22-1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "frameworks": ["astro", "vite", "eleventy", "docusaurus", "vitepress", "vuepress", "gatsby", "nextjs-export", "nuxt-generate", "sveltekit-static", "angular-static", "remix-spa", "generic"]
    },
    "bun:1": {
      "tag": "ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/bun:1-1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "frameworks": ["astro", "vite", "generic"]
    },
    "hugo:latest": {
      "tag": "ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/hugo:1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "frameworks": ["hugo"]
    },
    "zola:latest": {
      "tag": "ghcr.io/mincemeat-id/build-engine-images/zola:1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "frameworks": ["zola"]
    }
  },
  "engine_compat": {
    "proto_min": 1,
    "proto_max": 1,
    "engine_min": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Manifest version is immutable once released.
- Every image entry must include a digest.
- Engine pulls by digest when available.
- Build-engine releases pin an accepted manifest version range.

## Security And Supply Chain

Publication requirements:

- Trivy scan on every PR and release build.
- SBOM generated in CycloneDX format.
- Cosign keyless signature on every published image **and** on the released
  `manifest.json` (cosign blob signature attached to the GitHub Release).
- SLSA provenance attached to every published image and to the released
  manifest.
- Post-publish verification: every publish job re-runs `cosign verify` and
  `cosign verify-attestation` against the just-pushed digest. A publish whose
  signature or provenance does not verify is treated as a failed publish.
- Immutable release tags (enforced via the GHCR REST API).
- Weekly rebuild scan.

### SLSA Level Claim

The build pipeline targets **SLSA Build Level 3** ("hosted, hardened, signed
provenance") by:

- Building on GitHub-hosted ephemeral runners (`ubuntu-24.04`), pinned via
  immutable runner images.
- Generating non-falsifiable provenance with
  [`actions/attest-build-provenance`](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance),
  which uses the workflow's `id-token` to issue a Sigstore Fulcio certificate
  whose subject identifies this repository + workflow path.
- Pushing the in-toto SLSA provenance predicate to the registry beside the
  image manifest (`push-to-registry: true`).
- Producing a registry-side image digest from `docker/build-push-action`'s
  `outputs.digest` (single source of truth) so the cosign signature, the
  SLSA attestation, the `manifest.json` digest entry, and the engine's
  `pull-by-digest` are all bound to the same `sha256:...`.

Verification recipes for downstream consumers live in
[verification.md](./verification.md).

CVE budget:

| Severity                    | Policy                                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical with fix           | Block publish.                                        |
| More than 5 high with fixes | Block publish.                                        |
| High without fix            | Require maintainer acknowledgement in release notes.  |
| Medium with fix             | Warn.                                                 |

Secret policy:

- No secrets in Dockerfiles, layers, build args, labels, test fixtures, or
  published artifacts.
- CI uses short-lived GitHub OIDC permissions for GHCR/cosign where possible.

## Publication Flow

PR:

1. Build changed images.
2. Run fixture smoke tests.
3. Run Trivy.
4. Generate SBOM/provenance as artifacts.
5. Do not publish stable tags.

Merge to main:

1. Rebuild images.
2. Push RC tags.
3. Sign RC images.
4. Publish candidate manifest artifact.

Release:

1. Maintainer cuts release `vX.Y.Z`.
2. Workflow rebuilds and pushes immutable release tags.
3. Workflow records digests into `manifest.json`.
4. Workflow signs images and attaches SBOM/provenance.
5. Workflow opens PR in `mincemeat-id/build-engine` to bump accepted manifest.

Rollback:

- Revert manifest bump in `build-engine`.
- Redeploy engine with previous accepted manifest.
- Do not mutate existing image tags.

See [rollback.md](./rollback.md) for the detailed rollback procedure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every image builds reproducibly in CI.
- Every released image has digest, SBOM, provenance, and cosign signature.
- `manifest.json` contains only digest-pinned published images.
- Fixture smoke tests pass for all supported frameworks.
- Critical/high vulnerability gate blocks publication as defined.
- No secrets appear in image layers or repo scan.
- Build-engine can pull every manifest image by digest.
